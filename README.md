# ertglobalmansion
This is a legacy web project

This repo contains all the files needed to run a legacy website called 'ertglobalmansion'.
The website itself was a community service project I had made with some of my colleagues at Universitas Multimedia Nusantara (UMN) in 2019.
It displays the local neighbourhood association, its caretakers, services, roles, and other important information for the local community living in the area.
Some technologies being used here are PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
